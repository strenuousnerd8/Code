# Write a function called delete_starting_evens() that has a parameter named lst.
# The function should remove elements from the front of lst until the front of the list is not even. The function should then return lst.
# For example if lst started as [4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15], then delete_starting_evens(lst) should return [11, 12, 15].
# Make sure your function works even if every element in the list is even.
def delete_starting_evens(lst):
    while (len(lst) > 0 and lst[0] % 2 == 0):
        lst = lst[1:]
    return lst

print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15]))
